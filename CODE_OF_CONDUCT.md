# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Claim Forge community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Emotional Safety Commitment (CCCP Principles)

Beyond traditional codes of conduct, Claim Forge is committed to **emotional safety** for all contributors:

- **Anxiety Reduction**: Recognize that contributors may experiment, make mistakes, or ask "basic" questions
- **Reversibility**: All changes are reversible; no contribution is irreversibly "wrong"
- **Psychological Safety**: Create space where people feel safe to:
  - Ask clarifying questions
  - Admit uncertainty
  - Request help
  - Propose unconventional ideas
  - Disagree respectfully

## Our Standards

### Examples of Behavior That Contributes to a Positive Environment

- 🌱 **Supportive**: Using welcoming and inclusive language
- 🤝 **Collaborative**: Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- 💡 **Constructive**: Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- 🎯 **Focused**: Focusing on what is best for the community and project
- ❤️ **Empathetic**: Showing empathy towards other community members
- 🔄 **Patient**: Recognizing that contributors have varying experience levels
- 🧠 **Curious**: Asking questions to understand, not to judge
- 🏅 **Appreciative**: Acknowledging others' contributions, big and small

### Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

- ❌ The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- ❌ Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- ❌ Public or private harassment
- ❌ Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- ❌ Dismissing or belittling questions as "obvious" or "basic"
- ❌ Gatekeeping: implying contributors aren't "real" developers/engineers
- ❌ Condescending explanations (e.g., "well, actually..." without adding value)
- ❌ Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Emotional Safety Violations

Beyond traditional harassment, we also consider these harmful:

- ❌ **Anxiety Amplification**: Making contributors afraid to experiment or ask questions
- ❌ **Perfectionism Enforcement**: Demanding perfection in first drafts or proposals
- ❌ **Irreversibility Framing**: Framing reversible decisions as permanent/catastrophic
- ❌ **Psychological Pressure**: Using guilt, shame, or fear to motivate contributions
- ❌ **Experience Shaming**: Implying someone's experience level disqualifies their input

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (see [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Participating in project forums, issue trackers, or pull requests

## Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

Claim Forge uses a graduated trust model for contributions. See [TPCF.md](TPCF.md) for details.

### Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox (Everyone)

**Who**: Anyone with a GitHub account
**Access**: Read, fork, create issues, submit pull requests
**Trust Level**: Low (public internet)
**Code of Conduct**: Fully applies

### Perimeter 2: Trusted Contributors (Vetted)

**Who**: Contributors with >= 3 accepted contributions
**Access**: Direct commit to feature branches, review permissions
**Trust Level**: Medium (proven track record)
**Code of Conduct**: Fully applies + mentorship responsibilities

### Perimeter 1: Core Maintainers (High Trust)

**Who**: Project maintainers (see [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md))
**Access**: Merge to main, release permissions, security access
**Trust Level**: High (established trust)
**Code of Conduct**: Fully applies + exemplar responsibilities

**Key Principle**: This Code of Conduct applies equally at all perimeter levels. Trust affects access, not behavioral standards.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: conduct@hyperpolymath.example
- **GitHub**: Confidential message to maintainers (see [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md))
- **Emergency**: If immediate safety concern, contact GitHub support

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

- Reports are confidential to the enforcement team
- Reporter identity is protected unless explicit permission given
- Details of the incident are only shared on a need-to-know basis

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Acknowledgment of report
- **7 days**: Initial assessment and action (if needed)
- **30 days**: Final resolution communicated to reporter

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Example**: First-time minor offense (e.g., single dismissive comment)

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Example**: Pattern of condescending behavior, multiple reports

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Duration**: Typically 1-6 months

**Example**: Deliberate intimidation, sustained harassment

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

**Example**: Severe harassment, doxxing, threats of violence

### 5. Restorative Measures (Experimental)

For first-time violations where both parties are willing:

**Community Impact**: Minor to moderate violation with potential for learning

**Consequence**: Facilitated conversation between parties (with neutral moderator) to:
- Understand impact
- Repair harm
- Establish understanding
- Restore relationship (if possible)

**Goal**: Transform conflict into learning opportunity

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error:

1. **Email**: conduct-appeals@hyperpolymath.example
2. **Include**:
   - Original incident summary
   - Enforcement action taken
   - Reason you believe it was in error
   - Supporting evidence
3. **Timeline**: Appeals reviewed within 14 days
4. **Decision**: Final decision by different maintainer than original enforcer

## Emotional Temperature Metrics (Optional)

To measure emotional safety, we track (opt-in, anonymized):

- **Experiment Rate**: % of contributors who try experimental features
- **Question Rate**: Number of clarifying questions asked per issue/PR
- **Reversal Rate**: % of changes that are later modified/reverted (reversibility in action)
- **Anxiety Self-Reports**: Optional contributor surveys on psychological safety

**Goal**: Increase experimentation and question-asking; normalize reversibility
