/* RECONSTRUCTION */

Original Author: Unknown (codebase lost)
Reconstructed By: Claude Code (Anthropic)
Reconstruction Date: 2025-11-22
Reconstruction Method: Autonomous development from deployment guide
Reconstruction Confidence: ~78% (see RECONSTRUCTION_SUMMARY.md)

/* THANKS */

- AdaCore: For GNAT compiler and Ada toolchain
- OpenTimestamps: For blockchain timestamping
- GnuPG: For cryptographic signing
- Git: For version control
- Fedora Project: For container base image
- SaltStack: For automation framework

/* PHILOSOPHY */

Claim Forge embodies:

1. Type Safety First
   - Ada 2012 strong typing for legal/IP contexts
   - Compile-time guarantees over runtime checks
   - Memory safety without garbage collection

2. Offline-First
   - Works air-gapped for sensitive IP work
   - Optional network features (OTS, Git push)
   - No telemetry, no tracking

3. Cryptographic Integrity
   - GPG signatures for authenticity
   - OpenTimestamps for blockchain anchoring
   - Signed Git commits/tags for provenance

4. Transparency
   - All assumptions documented (ASSUMPTIONS.md)
   - Reconstruction process fully disclosed
   - Open source (MIT + Palimpsest v0.8)

5. Emotional Safety (CCCP Principles)
   - Clear contribution guidelines
   - Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)
   - Respectful community interactions

/* ACKNOWLEDGMENTS */

This project was reconstructed from a deployment guide after the original
codebase was lost. The reconstruction demonstrates:

- Ada's suitability for legal/IP contexts
- Type safety as foundational security
- Offline-first design for privacy
- Blockchain timestamping for provenance
- Multi-layered cryptographic verification

Special thanks to the Ada community for maintaining excellent documentation
and tooling that made this reconstruction possible.
