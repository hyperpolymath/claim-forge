# Security Policy for Claim Forge

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### Preferred Reporting Methods

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/claim-forge/security/advisories/new
   - Fill out the advisory form
   - Our team will respond within 48 hours

2. **Email** (For sensitive disclosures)
   - Send encrypted email to: security@hyperpolymath.example
   - Use our GPG key: [fingerprint placeholder]
   - Include "SECURITY" in subject line

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof of concept (if applicable)
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **48 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **7 days**: Preliminary assessment
- **30 days**: Fix development and testing
- **60 days**: Public disclosure (coordinated)

## Security Features

Claim Forge implements multiple security layers:

1. **Type Safety**: Ada 2012 strong typing prevents type confusion
2. **Memory Safety**: No dynamic allocation, bounded strings prevent buffer overflows
3. **No Unsafe Code**: Zero unsafe blocks in entire codebase
4. **Cryptographic Signing**: GPG signatures for all claims
5. **Blockchain Anchoring**: OpenTimestamps for tamper-proof timestamps
6. **Signed Commits**: All commits GPG-signed by maintainers

## Scope

### In Scope
- Core Ada application (src/*.adb, src/*.ads)
- Build system (Makefile, claim-forge.gpr, .gitlab-ci.yml)
- Container images (Containerfile)
- Scripts (setup.sh, bin/monitor.sh)
- Documentation rendering vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope
- Third-party dependencies (report to upstream)
- GPG/OpenTimestamps client vulnerabilities (report to respective projects)
- Operating system vulnerabilities
- Physical security of development machines
- Social engineering attacks

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Verify Downloads**: Check GPG signatures on releases
2. **Build from Source**: Compile from audited source code
3. **Secure GPG Keys**: Use hardware security modules for production
4. **Audit Claims**: Review claim files before signing
5. **Network Isolation**: Run in air-gapped environment for sensitive work

## Known Security Considerations

### Ada-Specific
- **Shell Command Execution**: GPG/Git/OTS called via shell (see ASSUMPTIONS.md #8)
  - Mitigation: Input sanitization, bounded strings
  - Future: Native Ada bindings

### Cryptographic
- **GPG Key Management**: User responsibility (documented in README.md)
  - Mitigation: Clear documentation, no key storage
  - Best Practice: Hardware security keys

### Supply Chain
- **GNAT Compiler**: Trust in AdaCore toolchain
  - Mitigation: Use stable, verified GNAT versions
  - Verification: Reproducible builds (future Nix flake)

## Safe Harbor

We support security research conducted in good faith:

1. **Legal Protection**: We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
   - Follow responsible disclosure guidelines
   - Do not access/modify production data
   - Do not perform DoS attacks
   - Report findings through proper channels

2. **Recognition**: Researchers will be acknowledged in:
   - SECURITY.md acknowledgments section
   - Release notes for fixed versions
   - CVE credits (if applicable)
